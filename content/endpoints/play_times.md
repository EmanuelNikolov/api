## Getting detailed play times for a client id

***What is a client id?***
A Client ID is a unique identifier defined by you or your code. The idea is to generate a client ID that can be recalled for a certain user. For example, it could be a salted and hashed version of the mac ID or an external user ID. This ID can be used to save and recall play time data.
